# Mechanical Design Method (MDM)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of assembling a LEGO set using **Creo 9** CAD software. It covers key steps such as designing individual parts, assembling them, and running simulations to test part alignment, motion, and interference. The project also highlights common challenges encountered during the design process.






### Key Features:
- **Designing Parts**: Sketching, extruding, chamfering, and pattern creation.
- **Assembly**: Part alignment and connectivity.
- **Motion Simulation**: Evaluating motion and identifying interference or misalignments.

## Getting Started
To explore the mechanical design process using Creo 9:
1. Ensure that Creo 9 or a compatible CAD software is installed.
2. Open the provided part files and follow the steps outlined in the documentation.

## Parts Design
Several parts of the LEGO set are designed from scratch, with each part focusing on specific sketching and extrusion techniques. The steps typically include:
- **Sketching**: Using basic shapes such as circles, lines, and arcs.
- **Extruding**: Creating 3D geometry from 2D sketches.
- **Chamfering & Rounding**: Adding finishing touches to edges for better aesthetics and functionality.
- **Constraints**: Applying constraints like symmetry, tangency, and midpoint alignment to control part behavior.


## Assembly Process
Once individual parts are created, the assembly process begins by:
1. **Importing Parts**: Adding parts into the assembly environment.
2. **Part Alignment**: Aligning parts using constraints.
3. **Motion Simulation**: Testing how the assembled parts move and interact.
4. **Interference Checking**: Ensuring that no parts interfere with each other during motion.
